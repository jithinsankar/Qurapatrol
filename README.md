# Quarapatrol
After the government imposed lockdown , getting out of home for buying essential commodities or for hospital emergencies has been a tremendous task .So there is a need for a system to monitor people and load carrying trucks all across the country . 

To tackle the problem we have created 2 apps

- Track Me { for people going out from home }
- Scan and Track { for the patrolling police officers }

# Use case scenario
Imagine a situation , if a Person A has to go out for an emergency he installs the Track Me app and gives a request in the app and fill out the details about his need. After that a QR Code will be generated which shows the details about his journey .The generated code is actually a key to a cloud database where his realtime location gets updated. If he meets a patrolling officer B on the road he could simply scan the QR Code generated on the Track ME app of person A with Scan and Track and could now on collect the realtime location of person A where ever he goes until he reaches the home position . If person A takes a way too time or wanders everywhere officer B could directly call from Scan and Track . The same can be implemented in the case of Trucks too . The officers could verify if the trucks have reached location or if they are facing any difficulty .
